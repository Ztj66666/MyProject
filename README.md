# AI and NLP Projects
This repository contains various scripts and projects focused on Natural Language Processing and Large Language Model (LLM) orchestration.

## Directories

### NLP
This folder consists of implementations and exercises covering fundamental NLP algorithms. It includes work on tasks such as text classification, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and semantic similarity calculations. The scripts focus on utilizing PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers.

### ctrival_assignment_
This directory contains an ongoing project for an AI-powered travel assistant. The system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide travel recommendations and itinerary planning. It currently includes a retrieval pipeline built with FastAPI.

### langchain_demo
A collection of scripts for practicing LangChain and LangGraph workflows. These files explore agentic logic, including tool invocation, task planning, and state management within conversation chains.

## Technical Environment
The projects in this repository utilize the following technical stack:
**Languages**: Python.
**Frameworks**: LangChain, PyTorch, and FastAPI.
**Data**: Vector search and management using FAISS and Pinecone.
**Models**: Integration with OpenAI and Transformers-based models.
