# AI and NLP Projects

[cite_start]This repository contains various scripts and projects focused on Natural Language Processing and Large Language Model (LLM) orchestration[cite: 3, 5, 29].

## Directories

### NLP
[cite_start]This folder consists of implementations and exercises covering fundamental NLP algorithms[cite: 9, 39]. [cite_start]It includes work on tasks such as text classification, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and semantic similarity calculations[cite: 9]. [cite_start]The scripts focus on utilizing PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers[cite: 35, 41].

### ctrival_assignment_
[cite_start]This directory contains an ongoing project for an AI-powered travel assistant[cite: 30]. [cite_start]The system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide travel recommendations and itinerary planning[cite: 21, 37]. [cite_start]It currently includes a retrieval pipeline built with FastAPI[cite: 22, 34].

### langchain_demo
[cite_start]A collection of scripts for practicing LangChain and LangGraph workflows[cite: 30, 32]. [cite_start]These files explore agentic logic, including tool invocation, task planning, and state management within conversation chains[cite: 32].

## Technical Environment
The projects in this repository utilize the following technical stack:
* [cite_start]**Languages**: Python[cite: 30, 40].
* [cite_start]**Frameworks**: LangChain, PyTorch, and FastAPI[cite: 30, 35, 41].
* [cite_start]**Data**: Vector search and management using FAISS and Pinecone[cite: 21, 37, 42].
* [cite_start]**Models**: Integration with OpenAI and Transformers-based models[cite: 20, 35, 41].
