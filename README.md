AI & NLP Engineering Portfolio
This repository contains my personal implementations of Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms and explorations into Large Language Model (LLM) Agent architectures.


Project Overview
1. AI Travel Assistant (ctrival_assignment_) | In Progress
An intelligent travel assistant inspired by Ctrip, designed to provide users with automated itinerary planning and travel recommendations.



Core Technologies: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), FastAPI, and Vector Databases.


Current Status: Development in progress. I have completed the basic retrieval pipeline and am currently optimizing the recommendation logic.

2. LangChain & LangGraph Practice (longchain_demo)
A collection of personal practice code focused on orchestrating large language models and implementing complex reasoning flows.



Content: Implementations of tool invocation, state machine control flows via LangGraph, and multi-agent collaboration patterns.



Highlights: Development of stateful conversation chains capable of handling complex logical branching.


3. Classic NLP Algorithm Implementations (NLP)
Practice implementations of fundamental NLP algorithms to strengthen my understanding of underlying principles.




Content: Exercises covering text classification, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and semantic similarity calculations.



Objective: Deepening expertise in Transformer architectures and the engineering details of various NLP tasks.


Technical Stack

Languages: Python.


Frameworks: LangChain, LangGraph, PyTorch, and FastAPI.



Models: OpenAI API and Hugging Face Transformers.


Data Management: FAISS and Vector Search.
